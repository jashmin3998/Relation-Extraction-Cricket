What a Hundred for Mayank Agarwal. He scored 100* runs from 196 balls against New Zealand in the second Test match in touch situation. Top Class Innings from Mayank Agarwal.
According to them, if you have scored runs or centuries at home before 2019 that was absolutely easy and it doesn't hold any value in World Cricket. Everything makes sense after 2019. Don't be that hypocrite just to support your favorite player blindly. You know who you are.
MithaliRaj has played International Cricket for more than 2 decades. She has played in all formats, captained India in all formats and scored tons of runs. Let's wish her a very happy birthday.
Well played, Pant. What a knock under pressure, India was down and out then he scored 91 runs from just 88 balls including 9 fours and 5 sixes. He has missed lots of deserving tons in his short career in Test cricket.

A THREAD of the number of times Virat Kohli scored a 100 in Test Cricket when other Indian Batsman failed to score above 50 runs in that innings.
Azhar Ali scored most runs for Pakistan in test cricket since 2020. One innings failure and people are after him. If you can't have patience then this format is not for you.
Since the beginning of 2019 among those who scored min 500 runs Ravindra Jadeja has the second best average and has scored second most half centuries for India in test cricket. Some kind of turn around for Sir Jadeja as a batsman.
AB de Villiers is the only batsman to score more than 2000 runs at an average of 50 plus and at a strike rate of 100 plus in ODI cricket. He scored 9577 runs at an average of 53.50 and at a strike rate of 101.09 in 228 ODIs. Happy Retirement ABD.

Spotify Wrapped reminded me of how CSK finished it's 2021's IPL season on a winning note. My top played reminded me of how Dhoni played Tom Curran in the semis. Songs on repeat reminded me of how repeatedly Gaikwad scored big runs. The pause reminded me of our last season.
Most of the fans including me wanted them to retain Ishan over sky, but the fact is that sky scored 400 plus runs for three consecutive seasons, whereas Ishu just had one good ipl season.

Folks we could be in for 2012 India vs England Test Match Mumbai. Ajaz Patel has remarkably replicated performance of Monty Panesar. A first innings score of 400 runs will seal match. Tom Latham needs to play smart here as pitch is going to deteriorate a lot #INDvNZ #Cricket.
A Test Match which was truly special for us as NSG, was made even more delightful with a Virender Sehwag sizzler. #OTD '09 A knock which defied the definition of Test Cricket & made Brabourne Stadium come alive with its magical touch. Those 7 runs will be missed forever.
DavidWarner gets a start in this First Test match, then he will be the leading runs scorer. He will smoke this England attack. No Jofra Archer. He will destroy them in Australian conditions.
